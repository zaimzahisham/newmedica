# Project State as of 2025-08-26 (COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS)

This document provides the definitive current state of the NewMedica e-commerce platform, separated by backend and frontend components. This analysis was conducted against GEMINI.md / Warp.md specifications.

---

## Overall Status

**PHASE**: MVP Feature Implementation
**OVERALL ADHERENCE TO GEMINI.md / Warp.md**: 70%
**MVP READINESS**: 66%
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Implement Frontend Checkout Page (Remaining Work) (Task 1.5)

All critical blockers have been resolved. The project is in a stable state to proceed with the next high-priority tasks.

---

## Backend (`newmedica-backend`) - COMPLIANCE: 78.6%

**ARCHITECTURE**: ‚úÖ Follows GEMINI.md / Warp.md layered approach (api ‚Üí controllers ‚Üí services ‚Üí repositories ‚Üí models)
**TECH STACK**: ‚úÖ FastAPI + SQLModel + PostgreSQL + Alembic (compliant)
**CRITICAL ISSUES**: ‚úÖ All critical issues resolved.

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT Features (Working as per GEMINI.md / Warp.md)

*   **Framework & Structure**: FastAPI app with proper CORS, layered architecture implemented
*   **Authentication Core**:
    *   JWT access and refresh token creation/validation working
    *   User registration with conditional fields (Basic/Agent/Healthcare)
    *   Password hashing with argon2 (compliant)
    *   Current user endpoint (`/api/v1/users/me`)
*   **Product Domain**: Complete CRUD operations, category filtering, search functionality, media management
*   **Cart Domain**:
    *   `Cart` and `CartItem` models implemented with dynamic price calculation.
    *   All cart endpoints (`GET /`, `POST /items`, `PUT /items/{item_id}`, `DELETE /items/{item_id}`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Order Domain**:
    *   `Order` and `OrderItem` models implemented.
    *   All order endpoints (`POST /`, `GET /`, `GET /{order_id}`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Address Management**: All address endpoints (`POST /api/v1/users/me/addresses`, `GET /api/v1/users/me/addresses`, `PUT /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}`, `POST /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}/set-primary`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL + SQLModel + Alembic migrations configured
*   **API Versioning**: All endpoints correctly prefixed with `/api/v1`
*   **Data Models**: All core models now include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps with timezone awareness.
*   **Test Suite**: All backend tests are now passing with expected external library warnings.
*   **Configuration**: Secrets are managed via `.env` file.

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (Required for MVP)

### üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Admin Endpoints**: No approval system for Agent/Healthcare users (`GET /api/v1/admin/users`, `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/approve`)
*   **Validation**: `extra_fields` not validated against UserType schemas
*   **Linting/Formatting**: ‚úÖ Ruff, Black, mypy configured and baseline established.

---

## Frontend (`newmedica-frontend`) - COMPLIANCE: 66%

**ARCHITECTURE**: ‚úÖ Next.js 14 + App Router + TypeScript (compliant)
**STYLING**: ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS configured and working
**FORMS**: ‚úÖ React Hook Form + Zod validation implemented
**CRITICAL ISSUES**: ‚úÖ All critical issues resolved.

### ‚úÖ RECENT STABILITY FIXES

*   **State Management**: Migrated authentication and cart state to Zustand, resolving inconsistencies in the account page, cart view, and product details components.
*   **Cart Functionality**: The entire cart flow has been refactored and is now fully functional. State is managed globally with Zustand and synchronized with the backend.
*   **UI Refinements**: Replaced standard browser alerts with a consistent, custom alert system for better user experience.
*   **Product Detail Page**: Fixed a runtime error (`params should be awaited`) that occurred when navigating to the product detail page (`/products/[id]`).

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT Features (Working as per GEMINI.md / Warp.md)

*   **Core Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript strict mode enabled
*   **Authentication Flow**: Login/registration with backend integration, Zustand for state
*   **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation working (compliant with GEMINI.md / Warp.md)
*   **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS properly configured
*   **Dynamic Data**: Server/client data fetching with search/sort functionality
*   **State Management**: Zustand implemented for cart and auth state.
*   **Request Quotation**: Feature implemented for Agent/Healthcare users with an animated modal. (backend is not yet ready for this)

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED Pages & Components

**PAGES COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ `/` (Home with product carousel)
- ‚úÖ `/login` (Combined login/registration)
- ‚úÖ `/products` (Product listing with search/sort)
- ‚úÖ `/products/category/[category]` (Category filtering)
- ‚úÖ `/products/[id]` (Product detail with gallery, quantity selector, and request quotation)
- ‚úÖ `/account` (User dashboard)
- ‚úÖ `/account/details` (Profile viewing)
- ‚úÖ `/account/address` (Address management: list/add/edit/delete/set-primary with animations and alerts)
- ‚úÖ `/cart` (Shopping cart is now fully functional)
- ‚úÖ `/checkout` (Prefill from primary; ‚ÄúUse saved address‚Äù with ‚ÄúNew address‚Äù; Payment method section; Stripe redirect working; success/cancel pages)

**COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED**:
- Navigation: `Navbar` (with dynamic cart count), `Footer`, `ThemeToggleButton`
- Product: `ProductCard`, `ProductCarousel`, `ProductGrid`, `ProductDetails`
- UI: `SearchBar`, `SortDropdown`, `ProductFilters`, `QuantitySelector`
- Forms: `ProductImageGallery`, `AddToCartConfirmation` (animated), `RequestQuotationModal` (animated)
- Cart: `CartItem`, `EmptyCart`, `FeaturedProducts`

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (Required for MVP)

1.  **MISSING CORE MVP PAGES**:
    *   ‚ùå `/orders` - Order history page
    *   ‚ùå `/admin` - Admin user management
2.  **INCOMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY**:
    *   `/checkout` - Pre-fill shipping address form with user's primary address (after Task 1.9 is done).
    *   `/profile` - Editable profile page (frontend for Task 3.2)
    *   No admin UI components

### üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

1.  **ARCHITECTURE DEVIATION**: Not feature-first structure
    *   All components in single `/components` directory
    *   GEMINI.md / Warp.md specifies co-located components/hooks/schemas by feature
    *   Should be: `/app/(dashboard)/profile/_components/`

2.  **INCOMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY**:
    *   Account details form doesn't submit to backend
    *   "Complete your profile" section non-functional

### üîµ LOW PRIORITY ITEMS

*   **Accessibility**: No WCAG AA compliance validation
*   **Server Components**: Could leverage more RSC for data fetching
*   **Performance**: No image optimization beyond Next.js defaults

---

## Cross-Cutting Quality Assessment

### üî¥ CRITICAL MISSING INFRASTRUCTURE

*   **NO DOCKERIZATION**: Missing Dockerfile for both backend/frontend
*   **NO CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions workflows
*   **Frontend Linting Setup**: üü° PENDING
*   **Frontend Test Coverage**: ‚ùå Missing

### üü° SECURITY & PRODUCTION READINESS

*   **Environment Management**: ‚úÖ Secrets managed via `.env` file.
*   **Error Monitoring**: No Sentry integration
*   **Backup Strategy**: No automated database backups
*   **Reverse Proxy**: No Caddy/Traefik configuration

---

## NEXT ACTIONS FOR GEMINI CLI

**WHEN GEMINI STARTS**: Focus immediately on these high-priority tasks:
1. Task 1.11: Order Domain v2 ‚Äî pricing, vouchers, shipping (backend + minimal frontend)
