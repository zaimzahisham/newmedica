# Project State as of 2025-08-23 (Updated)

This document outlines the current state of the NewMedica e-commerce platform, separated by backend and frontend components.

---

## Overall Status

The project is in the early stages of development. Core authentication and product catalog management are now functional on the backend. The frontend has been updated to fetch and display product data from the backend, replacing the previous static implementation. A major debugging session has resolved critical issues related to data fetching and sorting. The project adheres to the guidelines in `GEMINI.md`.

---

## Backend (`newmedica-backend`)

The backend is built with FastAPI and SQLModel, with a clear separation of concerns.

### Implemented Features

*   **Framework:** FastAPI application is set up with CORS configured to allow requests from the frontend.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   JWT-based token authentication (`/api/v1/auth/login`) is working.
    *   User registration (`/api/v1/auth/register`) is implemented, supporting different `UserType`s (`Basic`, `Agent`, `Healthcare`) and storing conditional data in a `JSONB` field.
    *   An endpoint to fetch the current user's details (`/api/v1/users/me`) is functional.
*   **Product & Category Management:**
    *   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for Products are implemented.
    *   Endpoints for creating and listing Categories are implemented.
    *   Product listing endpoint supports filtering by category name, a search term, and sorting by price and name. **Sorting by date is currently not functional.**
*   **Database:**
    *   PostgreSQL service is defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   SQLModel is used for ORM.
    *   `User`, `UserType`, `Product`, and `Category` models are defined and mapped to the database.
    *   Alembic is set up for migrations.
    *   A seed script (`app/db/seed.py`) has been created to populate the database with initial data.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Integration tests for the authentication flow (`register`, `login`, `me`) are in place.
    *   Full test coverage for the Product and Category API endpoints.

### Missing Features & Areas for Improvement

*   **Missing Timestamps:** Database models lack `created_at` and `updated_at` fields, which prevents features like sorting by date and creates a significant data integrity gap. This is a high-priority issue to resolve.
*   **Alembic Issues:** The Alembic auto-generation process is currently failing, which blocks schema changes. This needs to be investigated and fixed.
*   **Domain Models:** `Cart` and `Order` models, services, and repositories are not yet implemented.
*   **API Endpoints:** Endpoints for Cart and Orders are missing.
*   **Admin Functionality:** No endpoints exist for admin-specific tasks, such as approving/rejecting `Agent` or `Healthcare` user registrations.
*   **Validation:** The `extra_fields` in the `User` model are not yet validated against a schema based on the `UserType`.
*   **Error Handling:** While basic HTTP exceptions are used, a more robust and consistent error handling strategy could be implemented.

## Frontend (`newmedica-frontend`)

The frontend is built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS. It has a functional UI for authentication and dynamic product browsing.

### Implemented Features

*   **Framework:** Next.js application with TypeScript. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   A combined Login/Registration page (`/login`) successfully communicates with the backend API to register and log in users.
    *   `AuthContext` manages user state and JWT tokens, persisting the token to `localStorage`.
    *   The UI dynamically updates based on authentication state (e.g., showing user info in the navbar).
*   **Pages & Components:**
    *   **Home Page:** Displays a product carousel with data fetched from the backend.
    *   **Product Pages:** `products/` and `products/category/[category]` pages now fetch and display data from the backend API. These pages use a **robust client-side data fetching pattern** to handle dynamic search and sorting.
    *   **Product Detail Page:** The `/products/[id]` page has been redesigned to match the target design, including a multi-image gallery, quantity selector, and dynamic promotions section. It now correctly renders rich text (HTML) for product descriptions.
    *   **Account Management:**
        *   `/account`: A dashboard page for logged-in users.
        *   `/account/details`: A page to view (but not yet edit) user profile information.
        *   `/account/address`: A page to view addresses.
    *   **UI Components:** A reusable `Navbar`, `Footer`, `ProductCard`, `ProductCarousel`, `SearchBar`, and `SortDropdown` are implemented. **Search and sort components are fully functional (except for date sorting).**

### Missing Features & Areas for Improvement

*   **Cart & Checkout:** There is no shopping cart or checkout functionality.
*   **User Profile:**
    *   The "Complete your profile" section on the account page is not functional.
    *   The form on the account details page does not submit data to the backend.
*   **State Management:** `Zustand` is specified in `GEMINI.md` for UI state but has not been integrated yet.
*   **Admin UI:** No admin-facing pages or components have been created.
