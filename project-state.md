## Overall Status

**PHASE**: Final MVP Tasks
**OVERALL ADHERENCE TO GEMINI.md / Warp.md**: 95%
**MVP READINESS**: 95%
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Task 0.1: Fix Incorrect Order Subtotal on Checkout Retry

### üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS
- **Critical Bug**: A critical bug (`Task 0.1`) exists where the order subtotal is not correctly updated on checkout retry.
---

## Running the Project with Docker

The entire NewMedica application stack (database, backend, frontend) is containerized using Docker and managed with Docker Compose. This provides a consistent and reproducible environment for both development and production.

### Development Environment (with Hot-Reloading)

This is the standard way to work on the project. It uses mounted volumes to sync your local code changes directly into the running containers, enabling instant hot-reloading.

1.  **Navigate to the `newmedica-backend` directory.**
2.  **Run the following command:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

*   This command automatically uses both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`.
*   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
*   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Production Environment

This command simulates a production deployment. It does not use hot-reloading and serves the optimized, built version of the frontend.

1.  **Navigate to the `newmedica-backend` directory.**
2.  **Run the following command:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build -d
    ```

### Stopping the Environment

To stop all running containers, run the following command from the `newmedica-backend` directory:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

*   **`build-and-push` job**: This job is active and has been successfully fixed. On every push to the `main` branch, it builds the backend and frontend Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub.
*   **`deploy` job**: This job is currently disabled (commented out). It is intended to deploy the Docker images to a production server, but has been disabled until a production server is available.

---

## Backend (`newmedica-backend`) - COMPLIANCE: 99%

**ARCHITECTURE**: ‚úÖ Follows GEMINI.md / Warp.md layered approach (api ‚Üí controllers ‚Üí services ‚Üí repositories ‚Üí models)
**TECH STACK**: ‚úÖ FastAPI + SQLModel + PostgreSQL + Alembic (compliant)
**CRITICAL ISSUES**: ‚ùå 1 critical bug identified (`Task 0.1`).

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT Features (Working as per GEMINI.md / Warp.md)

*   **Framework & Structure**: FastAPI app with proper CORS, layered architecture implemented
*   **Authentication Core**:
    *   JWT access and refresh token creation/validation working
    *   User registration with conditional fields (Basic/Agent/Healthcare)
    *   Password hashing with argon2 (compliant)
    *   Current user endpoint (`/api/v1/users/me`)
*   **Product Domain**: Complete CRUD operations, category filtering, search functionality, media management
*   **Cart Domain**:
    *   `Cart` and `CartItem` models implemented with dynamic price calculation. **Now includes subtotal, discount, shipping, and total in `CartRead` schema.**
    *   All cart endpoints (`GET /`, `POST /items`, `PUT /items/{item_id}`, `DELETE /items/{item_id}`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Order Domain**:
    *   `Order` and `OrderItem` models implemented.
    *   Integrated pricing engine (vouchers + shipping) into order creation; `total_amount` uses computed totals. **`CartRead` now returns these computed totals.**
    *   All order endpoints (`POST /`, `GET /`, `GET /{order_id}`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Pricing Engine**: `PricingService` computes subtotal, voucher discounts (user-type/product-linked, per-unit or order-level, min-qty), and quantity-based shipping via `ShippingConfig`.
*   **Config**: `ShippingConfig` model added (base fee + additional per item) with default seeding fallback.
*   **Vouchers**: `Voucher` + `VoucherProductLink` models; seed applied for Healthcare (RM20 off Barrier Cream) and Agent (RM40 per unit if qty ‚â•10 for Barrier Cream).
*   **Migrations**: Order v2 migration applied (new order/order_item fields, vouchers, shipping_config).
*   **Address Management**: All address endpoints (`POST /api/v1/users/me/addresses`, `GET /api/v1/users/me/addresses`, `PUT /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}`, `POST /api/v1/users/me/addresses/{address_id}/set-primary`) are implemented and tested.
*   **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information via a `PATCH /api/v1/users/me` endpoint.
*   **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL + SQLModel + Alembic migrations configured
*   **API Versioning**: All endpoints correctly prefixed with `/api/v1`
*   **Data Models**: All core models now include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps with timezone awareness. (Note: `ShippingConfig` is missing `created_at`).
*   **Test Suite**: All backend tests are now passing with expected external library warnings. (Note: SQLAlchemy relationship warnings observed, but not critical blockers.)
*   **Configuration**: Secrets are managed via `.env` file.
*   **Validation**: `extra_fields` are now validated on registration for Agent and Healthcare users.
*   **Admin Endpoints**: APIs for managing vouchers (CRUD) and updating shipping configuration are implemented.

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (Required for MVP)

*   None.

### üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Admin Endpoints**: User approval APIs are now the lowest priority (Post-MVP).
